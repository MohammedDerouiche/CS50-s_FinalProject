# **This is CS50** final project

After 11 weeks of high quality content, rich information, and hands on problem sets, the moment of truth came, it's the time for the `CS50 Final Project`.

There are a lot of ideas for the final project including:

- a web-based application using JavaScript, Python, and SQL
- an iOS app using Swift
- a game using Lua with LÖVE
an Android app using Java
- a Chrome extension using JavaScript
- a command-line program using C
- a hardware-based application for which you program some device
- …

But the project I’m interested in the most is the one that can showcase my data analysis skills, because my goal is to land a job as a data analyst so I can take advantage of this project as portfolio project as well.

For the A Data Analyst, the most important skills that must be under his belt are:

1. SQL and databases
2. Math and analysis skills
3. Python programing language
4. Web develobment
5. Web Scraping

With that been said, let’s talk about my idea.

## **The Project Idea**
For this project I decided to build a `Job Analyser` website tool that helps people to know more about several job roles nad make the right decision for there future dream job.
