# **This is CS50** final project

After 11 weeks of high quality content, rich information, and hands on problem sets, the moment of truth came, it's the time for the `CS50 Final Project`.

There are a lot of ideas for the final project including:

- a web-based application using JavaScript, Python, and SQL
- an iOS app using Swift
- a game using Lua with LÖVE
an Android app using Java
- a Chrome extension using JavaScript
- a command-line program using C
- a hardware-based application for which you program some device
- …

But the project I’m interested in the most is the one that can showcase my data analysis skills, because my goal is to land a job as a data analyst so I can take advantage of this project as portfolio project as well.

For the A Data Analyst, the most important skills that must be under his belt are:

1. SQL and databases
2. Math and analysis skills
3. Python programing language
4. Web develobment
5. Web Scraping

With that been said, let’s talk about my idea.

## **The Project Idea**

For this project I decided to build a `Job Analyser` website tool that helps people to know more about several job roles nad make the right decision for there future dream job.

After saying that, there are some key tasks that should be done, which are:

### A. **Colecting The Data**

For collecting data needed for this project, I’ll go with building a web scraper for job search websites to scrape the job posts information.

#### Web Scraper

There is a lot of Choices when it come to the web scraping frameworks/libraries, but I'm gonna use to methods:

- API requests
- BeautifulSoup

#### Target wesites (Data Source)

There a lot of option here to consider but I want to take the most detailed, and not very hard to scrape website. Some of the options are:

- Monster:
- Job Bank:
- Indeed:
- SimplyHired:
- ZipRecruiter:
- GLASSDOOR:
- Career on stop

#### Requirements

- Python
- jupyter Notebook (For interactive programing)
- request library
